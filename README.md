# OpenAIAO Specification

## Introduction
The OpenAIAO Specification is a structured standard designed to optimize the internet for AI agents, enabling seamless interaction with online content, services, and business operations. The specification defines a common format for AI Agent Optimization (AIAO), similar to how SEO optimizes content for search engines.

## Goals
- Establish a standardized way for businesses and platforms to expose structured data for AI agents.
- Enable AI agents to efficiently discover, understand, and interact with online content.
- Reduce the overhead required for AI-driven automation and business integrations.

## Core Principles
1. **JSON-LD Format**: The AIAO specification leverages JSON-LD for structured data representation.
2. **Discoverability**: AI agents should be able to find relevant structured data through a standardized directory.
3. **Extensibility**: The standard should allow for industry-specific extensions while maintaining a core schema.
4. **Security & Privacy**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms where necessary to protect sensitive business data.

## Implementation
### 1. Directory Structure
A website implementing OpenAIAO should provide structured data in a well-defined directory:
```
/.well-known/openaiao/
    ├── index.json
    ├── products.json
    ├── services.json
    ├── contacts.json
    ├── custom_data.json
```

### 2. Index File
The `index.json` file serves as the primary entry point for AI agents to discover available data:
```json
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Example Business",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "openaiao:services": "services.json",
    "openaiao:products": "products.json",
    "openaiao:contact": "contacts.json"
}
```

### 3. Services & Products
Each service or product is defined in its respective JSON file using structured data principles. Example:
```json
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Service",
    "name": "AI Consulting",
    "provider": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "Example AI Solutions"
    },
    "areaServed": "Global",
    "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "price": "200",
        "priceCurrency": "USD"
    }
}
```

### 4. AI Agent Discovery
AI agents should query `/.well-known/openaiao/index.json` to fetch the available endpoints and process the structured data accordingly.

## Next Steps
- Define industry-specific extensions.
- Establish governance for versioning and updates.
- Develop reference implementations for WordPress, Shopify, and other platforms.
- Form an OpenAIAO working group to drive adoption.
